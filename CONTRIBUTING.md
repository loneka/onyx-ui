## Code Guide

### Code Structure

The source code’s structure is available for inspection under the `/src` directory. This varies between Loneka’s softwares, but is generally hierarchical, so topmost layers are a good starting point.

### Tech Stack

For a reference of our dependencies, consult the `pesde.toml` file located at the repository’s root directory. `dev_dependencies` are a list of CLI tools, and `dependencies` specifies used libraries.

Most of these are on GitHub, so just look them up!
